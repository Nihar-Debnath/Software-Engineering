# 🌀 Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) in Simple Terms

**Definition:**
SDLC is the **step-by-step process** of making software – from the idea to the final product and then maintaining it.

Think of it like **building a house** 🏠:

* You first plan,
* then design,
* then build,
* then check if everything works,
* and finally take care of it over time.

---

## ✅ The 6 Main Phases of SDLC (with Real-Life Example)

### 1. **Requirement Analysis (Planning Stage)**

👉 *What do we need?*

* Developers talk with clients/users to understand the problem.
* Gather all the requirements.

**Example:**
Imagine you want to build a **food delivery app** 🍕.

* Requirements: Show nearby restaurants, menu, add to cart, online payment, delivery tracking.

---

### 2. **System Design**

👉 *How will we build it?*

* Create architecture and blueprints.
* Decide database, UI design, and technologies.

**Example:**
For the food delivery app:

* Decide it will have three parts → Customer app, Restaurant app, Delivery boy app.
* Design database → users, restaurants, orders, payments.
* Make app mockups (like wireframes/screens).

---

### 3. **Implementation (Coding/Development)**

👉 *Let’s build it.*

* Developers write code based on the design.

**Example:**

* Developers code login, restaurant listing, cart system, payment gateway.
* Use languages like **JavaScript (React), Java/Kotlin (Android), Swift (iOS)**.

---

### 4. **Testing**

👉 *Does it work correctly?*

* Test the software for bugs, errors, or missing features.

**Example:**

* Test if the app shows correct restaurants.
* Check if payment goes through properly.
* Test if delivery status updates in real time.

---

### 5. **Deployment**

👉 *Make it live.*

* Launch the software for users.

**Example:**

* Upload the app to Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
* Restaurants and users start using it.

---

### 6. **Maintenance**

👉 *Keep it working & improve.*

* Fix bugs, add new features, update security.

**Example:**

* Add discount coupons, loyalty programs.
* Update app for new iOS/Android versions.
* Fix crashes if reported by users.

---

## 🔄 Summary with Real-Life Analogy

* **Planning** = Deciding what kind of house you want.
* **Design** = Creating blueprint of house.
* **Coding** = Building the house brick by brick.
* **Testing** = Checking if doors/windows work.
* **Deployment** = Moving into the house.
* **Maintenance** = Repairing and upgrading house.

                           new features/changes)
```

🔄 As you can see:

* The process moves **step by step**.
* After **Maintenance**, if new requirements come, it goes **back to Requirement Analysis** → making it a cycle.
